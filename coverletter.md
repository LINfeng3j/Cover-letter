## Dear GitHub Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the **[Job Title]** position at GitHub. As a passionate developer with a strong background in **[your specialization, e.g., backend development, open-source collaboration, developer tools]**, I have long admired GitHub’s role in empowering developers and supporting the global open-source community.

In my previous experience at **[Company/Organization Name]**, I worked on **[describe a project or responsibility]**, using **[mention tech stack or tools]** to **[what problem you solved or what impact you made]**. These experiences have strengthened my skills in **[skill 1]**, **[skill 2]**, and cross-team collaboration—especially in asynchronous environments.

Beyond my professional experience, I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub, including **[mention project if any, or describe general involvement]**. I highly value well-documented, maintainable code and community engagement, all of which align with GitHub’s values.

I’m especially inspired by GitHub’s recent work on **[mention something specific, e.g., GitHub Copilot, Codespaces, or an open-source initiative]**, and I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to such impactful developer-first tools.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to GitHub’s mission of building the home for all developers.

Sincerely,  
**[Your Name]**
