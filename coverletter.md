## Dear Hoyoverse Team,

Dear HoYoverse Recruitment Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Brand Marketing Specialist (Fresh Graduate) position. As a recent graduate with a deep passion for the gaming industry, I have long followed and admired HoYoverse’s titles, including Genshin Impact, the Honkai series, and Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ). I have been especially impressed by your excellence in multi-platform development, global storytelling, cultural integration, and user experience optimization. Your approach to brand and cultural communication resonates strongly with me, and I am eager to become a part of your creative and impactful team.

I have a solid foundation in mathematics, computer science, and data science, and I have applied these skills in various academic and project-based settings. For instance, in a recent group research project, we analyzed graduation rate disparities between transfer students and first-time students in university environments. I played a key role in proposing hypotheses, structuring demographic subcategories (such as gender and STEM majors), and leading the data collection and analysis. This experience sharpened my programming skills, teamwork, and analytical thinking—skills I believe are equally essential in brand marketing, where understanding audiences and interpreting trends are critical.

In addition, I have a strong understanding of ACG (anime, comics, and games) culture, and I am fluent in both English and Mandarin, with conversational proficiency in Japanese. My interest in ACG also led me to explore classical literature such as A Midsummer Night’s Dream and The Count of Monte Cristo, which I further studied through AP Literature in high school. These experiences have strengthened my ability to collaborate in multicultural teams and to understand the diverse cultural backgrounds and emotional values of global players. I am also a fast learner and thrive in fast-paced, iterative environments.

HoYoverse’s mission of “Tech Otakus Save the World” deeply inspires me. I am confident that my unique combination of analytical training, cultural literacy, and passion for interactive storytelling can make a meaningful contribution to your brand marketing team. I would be honored to support your efforts in content strategy, global outreach, and creative brand development.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to HoYoverse’s vision and global success.

Sincerely,  
**[Linfeng Jiang]**
